## Description [![start with why](https://img.shields.io/badge/start%20with-why%3F-brightgreen.svg?style=flat)](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action)

* As recent Boot Camp Coding student, I wished could connect fellow students to study the curriculum even further. I want to have the option to review weekly course material or past materials. But meeting face to face with a student can be a challenge depending on our location and especially now during the pandemic.The Study Wall will allow students to log in, post a study subject in the calendar and gives other students the ability to join the group chat so you are not alone studying by yourself.

## Installation

The app is deployed on Heroku: [The Study Wall](https://lets-study-together.herokuapp.com/)
## Usage

When the user loads the page, the user is able to sign up before they have access to features of the app. Once the user signs up they are in the database and they can now log in. Once you log in the members page displays a calendar where the user will be able to choose what topic they would like to study. 
The user should be able to:

  * Choose a time to have the study.

  * View the details on what is being discussed on different days.

  * Join a study wall that will link them to a zoom clone once there scheduled time comes up.
